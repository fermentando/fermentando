## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fernando Hidalgo Pineda (@fermentando).
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a PhD student in **Computational Astrophysics** at the **Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics**. My research focuses on understanding the universe combining theoretical and observational astronomy.

### ðŸ§  Research Interests
- **Galaxy Formation**: Modelling the processes driving the formation and evolution of galaxies.
- **Multiphase gas dynamics**: Investigating the ubiquitousness and interactions of gas phases, such as in galaxy clusters, circumgalactic medium or star-forming regions.
- **High-Performance Computing**: Developing astrophysical codes.
