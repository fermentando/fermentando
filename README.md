## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fernando Hidalgo Pineda (@fermentando).
Iâ€™m a PhD student in **Computational Astrophysics** at the **Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics**. My research focuses on understanding galactic flows from a theoretical standpoint.

### ðŸ§  Research Interests
- **Galaxy Formation**: Modelling the processes driving the formation and evolution of galaxies.
- **Multiphase gas dynamics**: Investigating the ubiquitousness and interactions of multiphase systems, such as in galaxy clusters, circumgalactic medium or star-forming regions.
- **High-Performance Computing**: Working with astrophysical codes.

### ðŸ“„ Accessibility
You can check my previous publications [here on NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3Aastronomy%20OR%20database%3Aphysics)&p_=0&q=%20author%3A%22fernando%20hidalgo-pineda%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=pgbziCYAAAAJ).
